## Portfolio Overview

Designed with a focus on aesthetics and usability, this website serves as a platform to highlight my education, interests, and the projects I've undertaken. The portfolio is organized into two key sections:

1. **Profile**: Features my photo, name, and essential details about my academic background and personal interests.
2. **Projects**: A curated list of projects I've developed, each accompanied by comprehensive descriptions and links to their corresponding GitHub repositories. You'll also find images or GIFs that illustrate the functionality of each project.

### Technologies Employed

- **HTML**: The backbone structure of the website.
- **SASS**: For styling and layout, utilizing gradient and multicolor effects to enhance visual appeal.
- **TypeScript**: Implemented for an interactive image carousel on the profile section, allowing a dynamic showcase of photos.
- **Git**: For effective code versioning and management.

Feel free to explore the site and connect with me!
